# Chatbot Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for creating a simple chatbot using Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The chatbot is based on a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) and can generate responses based on user input. This README provides an overview of the contents and usage of the notebook.

## Introduction

Chatbots are a popular application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the creation of a simple chatbot using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The chatbot is based on the GPT-2 language model, but you can customize it for specific tasks or domains.

## Prerequisites

Before using the chatbot notebook, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install them using `pip`):
  - transformers
  - torch

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```
## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`chatbot_notebook.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to create and interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

The notebook provides detailed instructions and code examples for each step of the chatbot development process:

- Importing libraries
- Loading pre-trained models and tokenizers
- Loading and preprocessing your dataset
- Tokenizing the dataset
- Optional: Fine-tuning the model
- Interacting with the chatbot

Simply follow the notebook cells to create your chatbot or customize it for your specific needs.

## Optional: Fine-tuning

The notebook includes an optional section for fine-tuning the pre-trained model on your specific dataset. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt the chatbot to domain-specific tasks and improve its performance.
